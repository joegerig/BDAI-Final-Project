This project looks at data related to bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea. The data, which was drawn from the UC Irvine machine learning repository, shows the total number of rented
bikes on each day/hour within the capital. Our code is broken into two distinct sections with one focusing on exploration and the other focusing on predictions. 

We hope you enjoy!
